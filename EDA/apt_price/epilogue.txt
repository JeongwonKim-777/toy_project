This is personal review for my poor practice.

At first, I should consider the factor which may affect price change, not the pattern of the change.

And, the objective is the prediction. I should show some kind of estimation of future price flow.

Finally, as first data importing to python, I had to use several pandas command to preprocess raw data.

Remember & fix it.
